Update: The Piracy Megathread has been moved to the wiki! We now have the freedom to have multiple collaborators rather than rely on a single person. Our mod team will be able to update the thread with new findings and we will also be looking for active contributors to add as wiki collaborators. This wiki format also works to our favor in properly sectioning off parts of the Megathread.
If you have any suggestions you'd like to see added to the Megathread, or would like to be added as a wiki collaborator, send us a mod mail here.

## PRIVACY

## VPNs
- Popular VPN services aggressively market themselves on Reddit. Do not subscribe to a service just because Reddit deems it popular, cheap, or because it hits the front page. You are entrusting an entity with your personal data; do your own research. Keep in mind that VPN experiences are completely anecdotal. Someone's experience with a particular VPN may vary from location, servers, operating systems, downloads speeds, etc...
- With that said, below are some resources with which you may begin your research. Most if not all popular VPNs offer trials and/or immediate refunds. Use them to your advantage in your quest to find a VPN that works best for you. Don't forget to also read their ToS!

	- [Which VPN Services Keep You Anonymous in 2017?](https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-anonymous-review-2017-170304/)
	- [TorrentFreak 2016 VPN interview](https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-anonymous-review-160220/)
	- [EEF Overview on what a VPN is and how to choose one](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you)

	- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Privacy/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Privacy/wiki/index)
- Beware of free VPNs if you plan on using one for online purchases or to log into websites with sensitive data. Many free VPNs are able to provide their free services because they data mine, interpose ads in searches, etc... 
- Beware of pirating VPNs. You wouldn't pirate a condom?
- [An alternative to purchasing your VPN is hosting your own](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/search?q=vps&restrict_sr=on). You will have much more flexibility and you can have your VPS hoster outside your country's copyright law jurisdiction.
